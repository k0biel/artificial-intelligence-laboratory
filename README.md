# Artificial Intelligence - Laboratories | Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology 2024

This repository contains laboratory assignments completed during the "Artificial Intelligence" course in the fourth semester. The tasks cover key AI concepts such as regression, classification, clustering, genetic algorithms, and neural networks, with implementations in Python.

Libraries used:
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **torch**
-  **pandas**

These libraries were utilized across various labs for tasks such as data manipulation, model training, and visualization.

## Lab 1: Linear Regression

This task focused on implementing linear regression using a closed-form solution and batch gradient descent. I evaluated performance with MSE and visualized the results.

## Lab 2: Genetic Algorithms

This task explored optimization using genetic algorithms. I implemented population initialization, selection, crossover, mutation, and elite strategies to solve the knapsack problem.

## Lab 3: Min-Max and Alpha-Beta Algorithms

This task focused on implementing the Min-Max Algorithm and the Alpha-Beta Algorithm to determine optimal moves in a two-player game. I explored decision-making, recursion, and heuristic evaluation to improve computational efficiency.

## Lab 4: Random Forest and Decision Trees

This task involved implementing a Random Forest and Decision Trees. I focused on bagging, finding the best splits using the Gini index, and feature selection to improve model performance.

## Lab 5: K-Means Clustering

This task involved implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm with two initialization methods: random (Forgy) and K-Means++. I implemented centroid initialization, assignment of data points to clusters, and updated centroids based on assignments, aiming to minimize intra-cluster distance.

## Lab 6: Artificial Neural Networks

This task involved implementing neural networks in Numpy and PyTorch. I focused on tasks like initializing weights for a single neuron and a two-layer network, implementing forward passes, and training models using backpropagation. I also worked on mini-batch data sampling and gradient updates during model training in PyTorch.

## Lab 7: Reinforcement Learning 

This task focused on implementing the Q-Learning algorithm for reinforcement learning. I worked on initializing the Q-table, updating it using the Bellman equation, and implementing an epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration and exploitation during learning.
